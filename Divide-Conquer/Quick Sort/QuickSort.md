## Time complexity: **[Best case & Avarage case : O(n*logn)],[Worst case: O(n^2)]**
## Space complexity: **O(1)**
## stable and in palce algo
## More efficient when randomized pivot used
## Recurrence relation: **T(n) = 2T(n/2) + Î¸(n)**

## Time taken by QuickSort, in general, can be written as following.
> T(n) = T(k) + T(n-k-1) + \theta (n)
